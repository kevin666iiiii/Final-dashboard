The student's expectations were met as they finished the assessment, reviewed topics, discussed SAT resources, and worked on test-taking strategies. During a low interaction period, the student likely reviewed problems silently before seeking clarification.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to finish up the assessment, review topics from the assessment, discuss resources for SAT preparation, and work on test-taking strategies. These expectations are addressed by the tutor as they plan to finish the assessment, discuss reviewing topics, mention SAT resources, and offer practice tests and test-taking strategies.",
