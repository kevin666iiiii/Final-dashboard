The student's expectation was to grasp solving quadratic inequalities, which the tutor successfully addressed through explanations, examples, and guidance. Periods of low interaction were observed for silent reflection, processing complex calculations, and gathering thoughts.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to understand and learn how to solve quadratic inequalities, including factoring and graphing solutions. The tutor successfully addressed the student's expectation by explaining the concept, providing examples, and guiding the student through the process of solving quadratic inequalities.",
