The student's expectation was to understand how to solve quadratic inequalities and graph them accurately, which the tutor successfully addressed. Throughout the session, there were several periods of low interaction where both the tutor and student were processing information, searching for examples, or reflecting on the math problems before continuing the discussion.",
