    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics related to quadratic equations, including quadratic inequalities, factoring, completing the square, and graphing solutions. The student's expectation was to understand quadratic inequalities, which the tutor successfully addressed by explaining algebraic solutions, x-intercepts, vertex determination, and graphing on a number line. Throughout the session, there were several periods of low interaction where both the tutor and student engaged in moments of silence to rethink, process complex equations, reflect on struggles with fractions, and consider the next steps in their discussion.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session was to understand quadratic inequalities and how to solve them, including graphing the solutions. The tutor successfully addressed the student's expectations by explaining how to solve quadratic inequalities algebraically, find the x-intercepts, determine the vertex, and graph the solutions on a number line.",
