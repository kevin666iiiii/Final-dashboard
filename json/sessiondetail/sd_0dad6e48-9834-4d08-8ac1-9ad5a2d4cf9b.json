The student's expectation of receiving help with practice questions was being met as they worked through the questions together. During a low interaction period, lasting from 1380000 to 1680000 milliseconds, the student briefly spoke with their mom, causing a momentary pause in the session.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to receive help with practice questions for a quiz they have the next day. They are looking for guidance on specific topics related to the practice quiz. The tutor is working towards meeting this expectation by asking the student to load up the questions and share their screen so they can work through them together. The student's expectation seems to be on track to being solved during the session.",
