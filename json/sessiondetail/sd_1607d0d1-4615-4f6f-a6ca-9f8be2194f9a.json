    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student focused on various topics related to exponents and simplifying expressions. The student's expectation was to prepare for an upcoming math midterm exam, seeking clarity and understanding. There were moments of low interaction when the student paused for the tutor to respond, resulting in brief silences.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to receive help with preparing for their upcoming math midterm exam. They have shared that they have a 504 plan, which allows for extra time and the use of a calculator during exams. The student is looking to improve their grade and has had previous issues with another tutor teaching in a confusing manner. They are seeking a tutor who can explain concepts in a way that they can understand. The student is also trying to share their study packet with the tutor for assistance during the session. The expectation seems to be met as the tutor is willing to work with the student to find the best way to share and work on the study packet together.",
