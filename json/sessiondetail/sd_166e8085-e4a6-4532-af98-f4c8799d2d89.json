    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics related to linear equations, including definitions, slope, solving equations, patterns, and graphing. The student's expectation was to review and understand linear equations, particularly in the context of word problems. Throughout the session, there were periods of low interaction where both parties paused to gather thoughts, check information, work on problems, or reflect on answers.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to review and understand linear equations. The student seems to be seeking clarification on how to approach and solve linear equations, particularly in the context of word problems. The tutor is addressing the student's expectation by explaining the concept of linear equations, their representation on a graph, and how to interpret and work with them mathematically. The tutor is also providing examples and explanations to help the student understand the topic better.",
