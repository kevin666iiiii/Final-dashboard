The tutor addressed the ACT tutoring request and introduced the concept of simplifying radicals. Periods of low interaction occurred for reflection, processing, and independent thinking during the session.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to learn how to simplify radicals, specifically square roots and cube roots. They also express interest in receiving tutoring for the ACT exam in the future. The tutor addresses the student's request for ACT tutoring and assures them that they can find materials online. The student's expectation for learning about simplifying radicals is partially met as they are introduced to the concept and given examples to practice.",
