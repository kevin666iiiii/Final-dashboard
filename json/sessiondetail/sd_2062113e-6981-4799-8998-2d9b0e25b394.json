    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics related to linear equations. The student's expectation included addressing test results and test-taking anxiety, partially fulfilled by the tutor's inquiry and support. Periods of low interaction occurred due to waiting for topic selection, technical issues, processing information, and formulating responses.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session seems to be discussing their recent test results and seeking guidance on test-taking anxiety and strategies for improvement. These expectations are partially addressed as the tutor inquires about the test and offers support for test anxiety.",
