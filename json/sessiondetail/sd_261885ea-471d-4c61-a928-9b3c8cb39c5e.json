    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various math problems related to optimization, derivatives, and maximizing/minimizing values. The student's expectation was to understand how to find the maximum product of numbers, seeking clarification on concepts like derivatives. Despite a technical issue causing a period of low interaction, the tutor addressed the student's questions and confusions, helping them gain a better understanding of the math problems.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session seems to be to understand and work through math problems related to finding maximum product of numbers. The student also seems to be seeking clarification on certain concepts and methods used in the problems. The tutor addressed the student's questions and confusions, providing explanations and working through examples. The student's expectations for the session were partially met as they gained understanding of the math problems but still had some confusion about certain concepts like derivatives.",
