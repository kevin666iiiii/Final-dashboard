    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics including function operations, definition of a function, composite functions, simplifying expressions, factoring trinomials, applying discounts and coupons, dividing functions, common factors in simplifying, and managing time blocks in sessions. The student's expectation was to better understand function operations, particularly adding and simplifying functions, as well as gaining clarity on the concept of functions and their relationship between variables. The tutor successfully addressed the student's confusion and provided clear explanations, meeting the student's expectations. Throughout the session, there were no periods of low interaction between the tutor and student.",
