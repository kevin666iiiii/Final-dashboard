    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed exponent rules, simplifying expressions with exponents, adding and subtracting polynomials, simplifying expressions with radicals and perfect squares, and simplifying expressions with cube roots and perfect cubes. The student struggles with freezing up and blanking out during math homework, seeking reminders and consistency. The tutor focuses on repetition and simplifying exponent rules to help the student understand and retain information, addressing the student's expectations to improve their understanding of math concepts and develop better study habits through explanations and guidance on effective problem-solving approaches.",
