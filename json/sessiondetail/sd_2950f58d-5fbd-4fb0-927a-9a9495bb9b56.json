    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed topics ranging from separation techniques in chemistry to various physics concepts like vectors, velocity, trigonometry, and optics. The student's expectation was to transition from chemistry to exploring physics, particularly understanding trigonometric concepts. The tutor successfully introduced basic physics principles and highlighted the significance of trigonometry in physics applications.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to transition from learning about chemistry to starting to explore physics for the next year. The student seeks guidance on where to start with physics and understanding concepts like sine, cosine, and tangent. The tutor addresses the student's expectation by introducing basic physics concepts and explaining the importance of trigonometry in physics applications.",
