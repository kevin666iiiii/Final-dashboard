    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various math topics, focusing on exponential and radical notation, arithmetic sequences, and understanding square roots. The student's expectations of improving math grades, preparing for a quiz, and seeking help with homework were addressed. Brief pauses occurred when the student left to print homework.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to go over their math grades, specifically focusing on understanding and correcting mistakes in their homework. They also mention preparing for a quiz and seeking help with upcoming homework. The tutor addresses the student's concerns about grades and emphasizes the importance of understanding the material for long-term learning. The tutor then proceeds to explain a math problem related to rewriting numbers using powers of 64, guiding the student through the process. Overall, the student's expectations for the session are addressed as the tutor helps them with their current math challenges and provides guidance on learning the material effectively.",
