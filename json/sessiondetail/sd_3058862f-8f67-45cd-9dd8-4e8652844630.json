The student's expectation was met as the tutor guided them through examples, explaining concepts effectively.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session was to work on solving linear systems, specifically focusing on understanding when a system has no solution or infinite solutions. The tutor successfully addressed the student's expectation by guiding them through examples and explaining the concepts of dependent and independent solutions. The student seemed satisfied with the explanations provided by the tutor.",
