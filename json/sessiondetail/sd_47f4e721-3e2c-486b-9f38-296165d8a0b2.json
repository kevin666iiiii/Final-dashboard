The student's expectation was to review and practice solving such equations, seeking clarification on removing square roots before squaring. Periods of low interaction were observed for reflection, processing information, and clarifying instructions.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to review and practice solving equations involving square roots, including more complex examples. The student is seeking clarification on the process of removing square roots from both sides of the equation before squaring. The tutor is addressing the student's expectation by providing explanations and examples to help the student understand the concept.",
