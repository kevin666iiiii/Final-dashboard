    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics related to parabolas, including translating parabolas, finding equations with given focus and directrix, and real-world applications. The student's expectation was to understand equations not centered at the origin, but struggled with identifying the correct formula and values, leading to moments of low interaction for clarification and processing.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session was to understand how to find the equation of a parabola not centered at the origin using given focus and directrix. These expectations were partially met as the student struggled with identifying the correct formula and values for h, k, and p.",
