    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics including functions, exponential growth and decay, graphing, piecewise functions, function comprehension, function composition, and test preparation. The student sought help with understanding functions, particularly finding f of x values, and the tutor provided step-by-step guidance. Throughout the session, there were periods of low interaction where the student needed time to process questions, calculate answers independently, or reflect on information, leading to moments of silence for individual processing.",
