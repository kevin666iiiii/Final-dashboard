The tutor successfully guided the student through solving problems, particularly on potassium iodide. Periods of low interaction occurred for the student to process information, calculate silently, and ensure accurate final answers.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session was to receive help with chemistry problems, specifically related to calculating the number of moles. The tutor successfully addressed the student's expectation by guiding them through the process of calculating the number of moles for potassium iodide. The tutor explained the concept of moles, atomic mass, and molar mass, helping the student understand and solve the problem.",
