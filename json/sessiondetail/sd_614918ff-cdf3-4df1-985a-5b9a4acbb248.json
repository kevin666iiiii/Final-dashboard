The student's expectations to review trigonometry concepts, solve combination problems, and find the radius of a cone were successfully met. There were no specific instances of low interaction during the session.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectations for the session were to review trigonometry concepts, solve math problems involving combinations, and apply formulas to find the radius of a cone. These expectations were met as the tutor guided the student through the trigonometry question, helped with the combinations problem, and corrected a mistake while finding the radius of the cone.",
