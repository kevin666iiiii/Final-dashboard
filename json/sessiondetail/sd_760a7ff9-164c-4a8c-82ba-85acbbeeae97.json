The student's expectations to improve skills in simplifying expressions, solving equations, and finding slope were successfully met. There were no periods of low interaction during the session.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectations for the session are to understand and improve their skills in simplifying expressions, solving equations, and finding the slope of a line. These expectations are met as the tutor guides the student through simplifying expressions, solving equations for x, and finding the slope of a line using the correct formula. The student also learns about the meanings of terms like \"simplify,\" \"evaluate,\" and \"equivalent\" during the session.",
