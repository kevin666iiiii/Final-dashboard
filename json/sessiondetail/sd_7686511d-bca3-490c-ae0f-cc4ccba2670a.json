    "aiSummary": "During the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student delved into various topics such as graphing polynomial functions, symmetry of graphs, multiplicity of zeros, and behavior of graphs near critical points. The student's expectation was to review material for an upcoming test, particularly focusing on graphing polynomial functions and behavior as x approaches infinity. Periods of low interaction occurred when the student was searching for test materials and needed time to recall questions, prompting brief pauses in conversation.",
