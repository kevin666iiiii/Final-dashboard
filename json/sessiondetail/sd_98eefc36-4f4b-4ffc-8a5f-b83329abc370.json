They also mentioned feeling nervous about an upcoming test and expressed a desire to improve their understanding of the material. The tutor attempted to address these expectations by trying to access the student's provided practice problems and working through a sample algebra problem together. However, due to technical difficulties and distractions, the session did not fully meet the student's expectations.",
