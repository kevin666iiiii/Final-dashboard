    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various topics including casual conversation, Christmas gifts, and the significance of PI in mathematics. The student's expectation was to learn more about PI digits and their relation to circles, which the tutor addressed by explaining PI's concept, use in circle calculations, and the initial digits of PI. Periods of low interaction occurred as the tutor gathered materials, encountered technical issues, processed information, and the student wrote down or struggled to recall PI digits.",

The tutor addresses the student's expectation by explaining the concept of PI, its use in calculating circle properties, and the initial digits of PI.",
