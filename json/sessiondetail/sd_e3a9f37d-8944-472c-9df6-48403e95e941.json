    "aiSummary": "In the one-on-one tutoring session, the tutor and student discussed various calculus topics, including finding tangent lines, derivatives of trigonometric functions, and second derivatives. The student's expectations were met as they worked on unit worksheets. Periods of low interaction occurred due to confusion, reevaluation, reflection, and uncertainty in understanding concepts.",

These expectations are met as the tutor guides the student through solving these types of problems.",
