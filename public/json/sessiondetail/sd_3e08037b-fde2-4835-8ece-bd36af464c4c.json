Throughout the session, there were several periods of low interaction where both parties were processing information, reflecting on problems, or working silently on tasks.",
    "desiredOutcome": "The student's expectation for the session is to work on math, specifically polynomial division using the long division method. The student is seeking help with understanding and solving polynomial division problems. The tutor is addressing the student's expectations by guiding them through the process and providing feedback on their answers.",
