Topics:  Rational Exponents: Combining Rational Terms:  Simplifying Rational Expressions

Reese and I worked on problems that required least common denominators.  We simplified Rational expressions using Laws of Exponents.  I gave Reese help with only the problems she couldn't do on her own.  Reese did a great job!  She understood the concepts and processes.  Reese still needs to BELIEVE IN HERSELF!  If she could get ways to immediately verify her answers to problems immediately, Reese's confidence level would be so much greater.

We reviewed Laws of Exponents.  Surprisingly this topic was the one Reese   
struggled with most.  While Reese understood the main topics, it was with the Algebra I skill topics that Reese was struggling with the most.  I'm going to pay particular attention, whenever we meet, that Reese's Algebraic skills are solid.

There was a bit of a problem that I need to make you aware of before Jonathon and I have our next tutoring session.  Jonathon was quite distracted.  His friend from golf sat next to him (off camera) and would answer questions I asked Jonathon; would tell Jonathon the solutions; or talk with him while I was talking with Jonathon. While our session was productive, Jonathon was not able to concentrate, or keep 100% focus, on what we were doing.  I tell you this only because I know you are paying a great deal of money for Jonathon's tutoring and I feel like you are not getting your money's worth if Jonathon cannot maximize his efforts on his learning.  Please let me know if having his friend there is permissible or not.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Topics:  Absolute Value-Solving equations and inequalities
_____________________________________________________________________________

Jonathon has a great understanding of the process to solve these types of equations and inequalities.  He knew what, and how, to set up the 2 Cases he had to consider when it came to BOTH equation solving AND inequalities solving when absolute value is included.

At the end of our session, I asked Jonathon to assess his efforts and describe what mistakes he had made.  It came down to 3, and ALL 3 were SIGN ERRORS, whether solving equations, solving inequalities, or performing a check of his answers.  More so than in any topic of mathematics, SIGN ERRORS will cause Jonathon to needlessly lose points on assessments.

   I ALSO had Jonathon come up with an EQUAL number of things that he did CORRECTLY.  I chose to talk to Jonathon, first, about the errors; and secondly,  to have Jonathon and  I assess his efforts to end the session in a positive tone.  I wanted Jonathon to openly and honestly assess himself so he knows what he truly needs to improve upon and what steps can bring about positive changes.  I also wanted Jonathon to hear what he is good at and what a teacher sees about him that he, himself, may not.

Great 1st Session!  Forwarding me a copy of Jonathon's Math 3 Syllabus was very helpful. Thank you!   :)",John Kang,,1,17466537,33722795

In both sessions, we reviewed the limit definition of derivatives, different rules of derivatives, and implicit differentiation to the second derivative. We practiced using assignments Anna was given, and the functions ranged from simple uses of the product rule to complex trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions requiring algebraic reasoning and more than one rule to solve through.

We managed to finish the assignments for the most part, but I did ask Anna to do a bit of research on the limit definition of derivatives in her class videos in order to learn why it's used, as we had run out of time by the time we got to that point.

Anna worked excellently over the two sessions. She has the derivative rules down, and she knows many of the more complex derivatives.

He finished with the real and complex numbers practice test, then went into the cumulative 12 question test practice quiz below. He scored a 3/3 on the 4th real and complex numbers test, and a 9/12 on the cumulative. The 3 questions he scored incorrectly, we reviewed. The first one involved finding the volume of a cone. Kaiden said he had not learned this prior to the exam. It was explained how this is often covered towards the end of an earlier math class he might have already taken, and/or he may not have remembered the equation for this geometric shape. Either way, after going over the explanation, he seemed to understand. The next question concerned transformations, specifically translations, reflections and rotations. This question was an example of a 180 reflection. The final question concerned a scatterplot, and determining the direction the points were heading. After reviewing all 3 of these concepts he missed, he said he understood. In the last part of the session, we tried to access a Legends of Learning math 8 level game to review transformations with similarity, but Kaiden said he was unable to move with the link provided, a game called Educagent.

Function Properties Review.
Angie has a test next week covering the basics of limits and some review of certain characteristics of polynomial and rational functions.  Angie had some review material, and she had a few questions on some of those exercises.  We looked at/covered/reviewed: a clarification of the concept of 'limit'; limits as  x  approaches a given value 'from the left' and 'from the right', and when a limit exists and when it doesn't; simple limits of polynomial functions, where a limit and a functional value are equal; continuity of a function at a given x-value; limits at x-values of discontinuity; types of discontinuity; discontinuities involved with rational functions; domain & range; interval notation; intercepts; and, evaluating and graphing piecewise functions.
Angie seems to be doing well with these concepts so far, and we should have another chance to look over the material for this upcoming test this next Monday.",Paula Poll,,1,17876698,34564138

Melissa shared with her mom that things were moving too fast and she wasn't understanding.  I think moving forward, Melissa will be able to get me her work in advanced.  This will allow me to create a lesson to support what she is working on with multiple examples and practice problems.  (Today I was hoping I had found the correct assignment, but wasn't sure.)

We did review some past concepts and I believe Melissa was feeling better.  We are planning on meeting next Tuesday at this same time.  My goal will be to go slower and have problems ready with places for Melissa to have to solve as a check for understanding.  Less of me saying, ""does that make sense"", instead I'll be able to see if it made sense as she is working.  

Melissa seemed very positive and eager to learn.  I'm looking forward to working with her.",Angelica P Perez,,1,17682700,34704551

Scatterplots and Linear Correlations.
Noah and I began the session looking at a few questions providing pairs of measurable data items (with, perhaps, a brief bit of story surrounding the pair) and asking Noah to - if possible - specify which item represented the explanatory (control) variable and which represented the response (observed) variable.  This work tended to be quite intuitive for Noah.
Following those questions, Noah uploaded 3 sheets of exercises presenting scatterplots (exhibiting the relationships in bivariate data) with questions regarding possible patterns in those plots in terms of linear correlation.  Working with these plots and the associated questions, we discussed correlation coefficient (r), coefficients of determination (r^2), the range of values for r, the significance of r^2 being equal to zero, and interpretations of the scatterplots in terms of the application (story) involved.  As well, here, Noah had a good sense for how these relationships fit and how they are useful.",Paula Poll,,1,19620236,38619676

For next several problems Amelia was requested to graph various linear equations.  Then the tables were turned and asked to identify equation given graph.  The next three provided two points on line and asked to determine equation.  Used slope formula and y =mx + b to determine y-intercept.  The final two problems were applications.  The first requested which payment method would be faster to pay off computer, with/without down payment.

Needed to determine either the tangent ratio or the other three sine/cosine ratios by applying Pythagorean Theorem.  Then it was a matter of multiplying groups of two fractions and then either adding/subtracting products to calculate final ratio.  Typically the fractional answers are already simplified.  Mentioned to Emily to make sure every ratio for the sum/difference of sine/cosine is in a range between -1 and 1 inclusive to work.  For most problems had to rationalize denominators.

We worked through several problems where we had to analyze both static and kinetic friction.

The main difficulty that was encountered is that the computer math program wanted Bella to describe in detail what she was doing to reach the final composite function. At the very end, I demonstrated for her using two very simple functions and explaining how function notation works and then instead of putting individual numbers into two different functions, I showed her how to put one function inside of the other function and then do the algebra to have a final composite function that she could use to find your answers. For example, if f(x)=2x, and you wanted to know what value you would get if you put five in the place of x, you would write f(5)=2(5), so f(5)=10.

I apologize I am invoicing this so far after Reese's and my session.  Apparently, the invoice I did fill out did not record on Varsity Tutor's Dashboard.

Reese had notified me she had a terrible grade on an assessment.  It was surprising as Reese had shown mastery of the material a week prior to the assessment.  She explained that the teacher taught a shortcut method THE DAY BEFORE THE TEST which Reese initially could do but ""didn't seem to work on the test.""  I advised her to always, always, go with the methods you know and have successfully mastered.  I have reworked the problems and am in the process of forwarding them to Reese.  

Reese and I met to work on application problems that involved rational functions and solving rational equations in one variable.  These problems are what students dread. These problems are also called ""word problems.""   

Reese and I set up the problems as the scenarios described.  We had a few problems that the problems were a bit ambiguous in their descriptions.  All in all,, the problems were solved and the solutions were reasonable.  I believe Reese will improve best by doing a lot of these types of problems.  Exposure to a variety of types of these problems helps any student to ""catch on"" to techniques that can be used over and over, and gives a student exposure to the many ways problems can be interpreted and solved. 

Reese did text me later about one problem and I assisted her with it.  Reese did NOT ask me any more problems so I am hopeful she was able to solve them on her own.

Keep up the HARD WORK, Reese!  :)",Trevor Large,,1,17506561,33345279

We continued with the motion equations from last time, working through more elaborate problems. When there are multiple different accelerations, such as a car accelerating from a stop and then maintaining a constant velocity, we looked at how to break the problem apart into different steps, with each segment pertaining to a different acceleration value. We worked through a problem on reaction time and how long someone will have to react in order to stop a vehicle in time. I showed her how we must first find the distance required to stop and then subtract it from the total distance before converting that distance to time via the initial velocity. We finished with some harder problems involving two objects intersecting. I went over how we should view the system from one of the objects and then compare the relative velocities/accelerations. Since both were accelerating due to gravity, I explained that the acceleration could be ignored and only the velocities were important at that point.",Chloe Pusey,,1,17761819,34777183

For the first example, 64x^3+125, we established the cubes of 64 and 125, which are also the values of a and b in the formula a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2). The values of a and b were 4 and 5, respectively. After that, we plugged in the values and factored the cubes. We implemented the same steps for the difference of two perfect cubes, 27x^3-8. Gabe understood the method. He hesitated a bit when multiplying the values of a and b, but he quickly corrected himself when I pointed out the formula.

We looked at different ways in which the quadratic equation is written and what the easy to identify points for each form are.  For instance, if we are working with an equation written in standard form:  y = ax^2 + bx + c.   We can look at the a value to see if it is positive or negative.  This tells us if the graph opens upward or downward.  We can look at the c value to see what the y intercept is.  We can also calculate the x value at which the vertext will occur with -b/2a.   All of these values give us key points to identify the approximate shape.  We can go further such as finding the x-intercepts as well if we need to.  It really depends on how much detail we need to put into the remaining graphs.  We talked about the remaining two forms that quadratics are written in and we talked about functional transformations:  starting with the most basic y = x^2 graph and applying each shift/transformation as an additional part of the equation until we have gotten to the equation in the problem and correspondingly can see what that graph looks like.",Zach Birbiglia,,1,19565367,38880964

- How to convert from slope-intercept to point-slope form
- How to find the equation of a parallel line through a given point
- How to identify the slope and y-intercept from a graph
- How to graph a line given an equation

We did some more math today, and also got to talk a bit about planetary science. Starting with planets, we learned about how the axial tilt of the earth causes seasons, where winter occurs whenever our hemisphere is pointed away from the sun, and summer occurs when our hemisphere is pointing toward the sun. We also defined the terms equinox and solstice, as well as the distance of the earth from the sun. 
In our math section we did more work with combining like-terms, and learned how it can make complex expressions much much much more simple to solve. We also made sense of the strategy for combining like-terms that are on opposite sides of an equal sign. We do this by adding something to both sides of the equation that will cancel out the term on one side, making everything look more simple. Even extremely complex equations, like the ones we worked on, can be reduced to just a few terms by using the concepts we went over. Another idea we introduced was that a positive and negative sign aren't stagnant operators. They actually belong to the number that comes after them, so we move them around together and combine the terms accordingly. 
Keep up the good work, Colton. We'll continue with this and I think you're about to make some incredible amounts of progress with your ability to solve equations. But, keeping this all in the context of the bigger picture: being able to solve complex equations is about knowing that you have the skills to solve complex, real-world problems and derive equations to help you get exact answers. As your ability to solve equations increases, you will start to see how the equations can be used to model real things that happen. Math will be at your disposal to help you solve whatever you may be interested in. ",Marc Schlecht,,1,20822853,36038268
